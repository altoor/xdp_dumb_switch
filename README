* Building

You need the complete Linux sources to build this, any
version above 4.18 should work. Possibly even older ones
(untested).

The Makefile will look for them in the usual location, but
some distros do not provide the full tree in the src package,
so you may want to download the sources from:

https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/

unpackage them somewhere and the run

KDIR=<your tree location> make

* Running

./xdp_dump_switch

you can comfigure the switch writing the commands:
* the it's standard input
* on the xdp_dumb_switch_ctl unix socket it creates in the
  running directory.

Available commands are:
- attach <nic>
  the switch will process the ingress traffic from such NIC,
  attaching an XDP program to it
- add <in nic> <src ip> <out nic>
  create a forwarding rule, matching the ip packets with the
  specified source from <in nic> and forwarding them to
  <out nic>
- stats <nic>
- quit
  guess what?
- detach <nic>
  guess what?
- del <in nic> <src ip>
  guess what?

* FAQ

Q: This is useless!
A: Almost. But you can run a PVP test using xdp_dumb_switch as
   backend with a varying number of L3 flows. And you can still
   patch it to something more interesting.
